# Time & Pay Calculator â€” Pro (Dark Mode Auto Detect)

This build includes **dark mode auto-detect**:  
If you have no saved preference, the app will follow your system setting (`prefers-color-scheme`). Once toggled manually, your choice is remembered.

Other features remain as in the Pro version:
- Weekly grouping, OT, weekend/holiday multipliers
- Custom deductions
- Dark mode toggle (with auto-detect on first load)
- Sticky mobile action bar
- Clock In/Out with timer and quick lunches
- Rounding and auto-break
- History with filters and import/export
- Inline warnings, copy buttons, CSV export, bar chart

Deploy steps same as before: upload `index.html` and `style.css` to GitHub Pages root.

## Appearance
- **Dark mode** supports **Auto**: when enabled (default), the app follows your system setting and updates live when your system theme changes.
